Be There - For Your Career

Thinkful Frontend Capstone Project

This app allows users to obtain useful information regarding job trends across the United States.

The has two main search functions which users can take advantage of:

Job Locations
- Users can search for a career field and obtain location data for cities and states with most jobs in that field
- Users will also receive a list of the specific job titles within this field; clicking one of the job titles 
will bring the user to glassdoor.com with the job title pre-filled for search.

Jobs Progression
- Users can search for jobs related to their current position and obtain information about these career fields
- Users will be given a list of the top five most commonly held positions by others with their current career;
clicking the 'find job' button will perform a 'Job Locations' search for that specific job.


This app comprehensively utilizes the frontend technologies of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript
as well as jQuery and d3.js

d3.js is used to render SVG charts and graphs with job-related information which users can use to have a visual comparison
(for example, seeing the number of jobs available as well as the median salary for that job as compared to others in the field).
An SVG map is used to display job density throughout the country. The map also offers specific statistics for 
the total number of jobs in each state as well as the nation as a whole.
